# xc-ce-training

Requirements!

vscode
git

1. Fork this repo to your githib account

2. Clone the repo to your local machine

3. You need to configure API access to your Azure account:
    - within the Azure `Mircosoft Entra ID`, navigate to `Manage` >> `App Registration` and create a new 'App'.
    - within the new 'App' you just created, create a new Client Secret.  The value must be saved, as you cannot retrieve it again:  
        - this value is your `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    - the 'App' overview page will provide:
        - the 'Application (Client) ID' is your `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
        - the 'Directory (Tenant) ID' is your `ARM_TENANT_ID`
    - 'Expose an API' by adding a 'Scope' and a 'Client Application', with the latter referencing your 'Application (Client) ID'.
    - if you type 'subscriptions' into the search box at the top of the Azure Portal, you can find your Subscription ID:
        - the 'Subscription ID' is your `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
    - **IMPORTANT** within your subscription, go to 'Access Control (IAM)' and 'Role Assignments'.  Add a Role Assignment and give your 'App' the 'Contributor Role'. 

4. Create Azure Storage Account.  Use default values except for the following items: 
    - Create new `Resource Group`
    - Enter `Storage account name`
    - For `Primary Service` select `Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (Standard)`
    - On the `Tags` tab, create a tag as follows:  `Name` = `Owner`, `Value` = `Your email address`
    - Click `Review and Create` and then `Create`
    - After creation navigate to your Azure Storage Account and on the left menu, select `Data Storage` >> `Containers`
        - Click `+ Container` to create a new container and give it the name `terraform-git-actions` and then click `create`
    - Again, on the left menu, select `Security + networking` >> `Access Keys`
        - Click `Show` the `Key` and make a note because we will use this in step 6 below

5. Login to XC and navigate to `Administration Workspace` >> `Personal Management` >> `Credentials` >> `Add a Credential`
    - Create an `API Certificate` credential with a complex (important for this training!) password and short expiry
        - Make a note of the complex password because you will use it in step 6 below
    - Copy `.p12` file to your cloned repo folder

6. Update variables and values:
    - Rename `vars.auto.tfvars.example` to `vars.auto.tfvars` and modify values to match your deployment
    - In `provider.tf` update the values for `resource_group_name` and `storage_account_name` to match the values you used to create the Storage Account in step 3.

7. In the github UI, make sure you are logged in and then navigate to your forked copy of this repo
    -  Click the `Settings` tab >> `Security` >> `Secrets and variables` >> `Actions`
    -  Create the following `New Repository Secret`s: 
        - Set `Name` = `AZURE_BACKEND_KEY` and for `Value` use the storage key you saved at the end of step 3 above
        - Set `Name` = `VES_P12_PASSWORD` and for `Value` use the complex password you saved in step 4 above
        - Set `Name` = `ARM_CLIENT_ID` and for `Value` use the application (client) ID from the app registration in step 3 above
        - Set `Name` = `ARM_TENANT_ID` and for `Value` use the tenant ID obtained in step 3 above.
        - Set `Name` = `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and for `Value` use the subscription ID obtained in step 3 above.
        - Set `Name` = `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` and for `Value` use the client secret obtained in step 3 above.

8. At the CLI, cd into the cloned folder e.g. `cd xc-ce-training` and then push your updated config to your git origin:
    - `git add .` or if you want to be specific `git add provider.tf vars.auto.tfvars`
    - `git commit -m "<insert your message here e.g. updated vars>"`
    - `git push` - this should trigger GitHub Actions to try your first deployment.
9. Review the configuration of your SMSv2 site in the XC console and your VM in Azure.
10. Delete your SMSv2 site in the XC console and your VM in Azure.
11. Use the ClickOps method to deploy a new CE, with the same settings as the original: 
    - Navigate to https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2
    - Scroll down and click `Multi-Cloud Network Connect`
    - From the left menu >> `How To` >> `Site Management` >> `Deploy Secure Mesh Site v2 in Azure (ClickOps)`
